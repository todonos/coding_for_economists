# First lookk at dictionaries

# A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs

#Syntax:
myDict = {"Dog": "Barks", "Cat": "Meows", "Cow": "Moo"}

print(myDict)

# We cannot use the same indexing syntax as with lists/ str
# print(myDict[0]) #error

# We can use the key to get the value
print(myDict["Dog"])
